1,Photos by @richardbarnes ," After completing a photographic assignment at the California Academy of Sciences I was walking out of the African Hall when I noticed a painter on a Scaffold repainting a scene in a diorama that had been damaged by smoke from a fire that had recently occurred. I was struck by the strangeness of the scene of this beautiful surreal savannah with giraffe, wildebeest, etc. wrapped in protective plastic, juxtaposed with the painter amidst the tools of his trade. I received permission to return to photograph and this chance encounter led me on to the path to what would become my obsession with photographing Dioramas throughout the world in states of removal, restoration and often, sadly, destruction. There is a strange, some would say disturbing, irony, in going out into the wild and culling animals only to re-animate them to grace the halls of natural history museums.

In 2005, the population consisted of 423 to 502 individuals, after having crashed in the 1940s to just 40 animals. By 2015, there were 540 of the tigers here. Anti-poaching efforts have been integral to the rise in tiger numbers, with tougher punishments for the illegal trafficking of endangered animals and their parts. Interestingly, and worryingly, a broad genetic sampling of 95 wild Russian tigers found markedly low genetic diversity. This lack of diversity is becoming an increasing problem across a multitude of species as populations crash, and are then brought back from the brink of extinction. A lack of genetic diversity increases the odds that a species will be vulnerable to disease, among other things. #notrade #noextinction- To see more of my work and projects follow me here @chancellordavid",949137,2601,"['tiger', 'wildlife', 'whiskers', 'mammal', 'snout', 'terrestrial animal', 'close up', 'fauna', 'big cats', 'eye']",0.26143088585200047,High

One of them became known as the Peruvian Ice Maiden. Maybe because it was my first National Geographic assignment, but I have always felt a strong connection with her.  She was a girl of 16 wrapped in exquisitely woven textiles frozen into the 21,000-foot summit ridge of Mountt Ampato. The weaving tradition was strong in this part of the Andes for centuries, but by the time I arrived it had languished. With a grant from National Geographic, the Centro de Textiles Tradicionales del Cusco has helped revive, preserve, and pass on the Andean weaving tradition. The women of this cooperative still dye yarn in the traditional way. Their work is wonderful. Today they make a replica of the Ice Maiden's wrappings.

Now the island is gone, wiped out by Hurricane Walaka. East Island was one of the Hawaiian Leeward Islands, an archipelago of atolls that stretches for a thousand miles in the Central Pacific. Even though they are mere feet above sea level, they are home to millions of seabirds and to endangered green sea turtles and Hawaiian monk seals. All of them are now threatened by the extreme weather episodes and the sea level rise caused by climate change. The aerial view in this set of photos shows Tern Island in the French Frigate Shoals. It has an airstrip built in World War II to serve military planes. After the war researchers were able to use the island as a base, but now the island has been abandoned and its future is doubtful. It may be the next island in the region to disappear. It's unclear where the millions of creatures who depend on these fragile islands can go when the islands become submerged.

As dusk falls, the birds take flight in dense cloud-like formations known as murmurations. Surging through the sky, staggering numbers of starlings maintain fluid and cooperative movements as a flock, performing acrobatic displays in the evening sky. Ornithologists are not quite sure why they do these flocking maneuvers and how the birds keep from crashing into each other. And like finding seemingly recognizable figures in the shapes of clouds overhead, we humans bring our own sense of order and wonder to the shapes the birds make, even though the starlings, most likely, have no knowledge that their movements were enthralling to me, observing, beneath them. Working with film and a Hasselblad camera at a fast shutter speed, I embraced the grainy effect of the analog process and its ability to recall the almost granular appearance of the birds in flight. #murmuration #contemporaryphotography #rome #starlings",706983,4389,"['sky', 'black and white', 'cloud', 'monochrome photography', 'tree', 'atmosphere', 'photography', 'monochrome', 'meteorological phenomenon', 'water']",0.20879183542560156,High

99,Photos by @gabrielegalimbertiphoto ," Do migrants have a past? Do migrants have a future? Or are they forever locked in the images of man on sinking boats, of women, babies in their arms, crawling under barbwire, of families waiting in line, stranded in the shadow of borders we thought had forever vanished? I have tried to see things differently. I have learned that these men and women actually had jobs where they come from and now dream of being able to work in Europe. So when I set out to photograph a group of migrants eager to reach Switzerland but blocked in the city of Como, in northern Italy, I decided to show them as they would have liked to be shown. Dembo as a baker, Osman as a bus driver, Noreen as a nurse, and Jafar as a policeman. These are just some of jobs they used to do and are skilled in. But Dembo, Osman, Noreen, Jafar, and many others are now living in lurid tents, camping out in a small park adjacent to the cityÂÃÂªs station in squalid conditions. These photos are their CVs translated in images. I have borrowed the language of publicity to show what reportage cannot. These photographs are not totally real. But they should be. In order to illustrate the enormous chasm between their present and a possible future, I have also done a series of still lifes of where the migrants actually sleep. ItÂÃÂªs in the space between these two worlds that the future of Europe will play out.

The reversal allows for these products to be used in medical research or healing, uses long since proven to have no benefits to humans. This change will certainly lead to more pressure on already terribly vulnerable animal populations and place in greater danger the conservationists, rangers and communities who fight for the survival of these majestic creatures. Here, Sudan, the last living male Northern White Rhino left on this planet is comforted moments before he passed away March 19, 2018 in northern Kenya. Sudan was brought to Kenya from @safari_park_dvur_kralove in the #Czechrepublic in 2009. He died surrounded by people who loved him at @olpejeta and has been an inspirational figure for many across the world. If there is any meaning in his death, its that Sudan can be our final wake up call. In a world of 7 billion, we need to start recognizing that we are not separate from nature. When we see ourselves as part of the landscape and part of nature, then saving nature is really about saving ourselves.Today, fewer 30,000 rhinos and 3,900 tigers remain in the wild.

142,Photo by @CarltonWard ," Did you know that the first modern cattle and horses in the United States landed on the Gulf coast of Florida in 1521? Ponce de Leon brought them on sailing ships from Spain during his second voyage to the New World. Although he was attacked by Calusa Indians (and later died of his wounds in Havana), cattle and horses remained. When my ancestors migrated into Florida in the mid 1800s, cattle had been living wild in the Florida woods for nearly three centuries. Descendants of these original Spanish livestock are called """"cracker"""" cattle and horses today. Early American settlers of the Florida frontier were also called """"crackers"""", attributed to the """"crack"""" of their cow whips. Modern horses actually evolved in North America but vanished during the mass extinction of mammals 13,000 years ago, near the end of the last ice age, around the same time when the human population was expanding throughout the continent. Much of the southeastern US was adapted to grazers. There were herds of wild bison in Florida as recently as the 1700s (and perhaps later). There are places today, such as the grasslands and prairies of the Northern Everglades, where modern cattle serve a beneficial role in maintaining native ecosystems. Cattle grazing in this region has been shown by @ArchboldStation to increase net carbon sequestration by grasslands. Ranches here also provide important wildlife habitat for bears, panthers and other native species while protecting land from development in the #FloridaWildlifeCorridor.

Today, it is still a place of great heat and frosts, and an annual rainfall of between 50 and 250 mm, though on some of the mountains it can be 250 to 500 mm higher than on the plains. However, underground water is found throughout the Karoo, which can be tapped by boreholes, making permanent settlements and sheep farming possible. The driest region of the Karoo, however, is its southwestern corner, between the Great Escarpment and the Cederberg-Skurweberg mountain ranges, called the Tankwa Karoo, which receives only 75 mm of rain annually. The eastern and north-eastern Karoo are often covered by large patches of grassland. The typical Karoo vegetation used to support large game, sometimes in vast herds, but today, sheep thrive on the xerophytes, though each sheep requires about 4 ha of grazing to sustain itself - to see more work and projects from here and elsewhere follow me @chancellordavid @thephotosociety @everydayextinction - #southafrica #thekaroo",269125,463,"['sky', 'highland', 'cloud', 'ecosystem', 'wilderness', 'horizon', 'steppe', 'atmosphere', 'hill', 'ecoregion']",0.07255365491092429,Low

I was, IÂÃÂªll admit, pretty lost. What at first was a slightly nervous moment as this warrior simply came and sat next to me, has over the years developed into a deep respect both for the man and his work with @ewasolions in the Samburu, northern Kenya. The African lion population has declined by 43% in the last 20 years and lions now occupy only 8% of their historical range in Africa. The estimated numbers of lions across Africa are approximately 20,000. In Kenya, the national population now numbers less than 2,000 individuals. At current rates of decline, the species could become extinct here within the next two decades. This reduction in lion numbers is primarily due to habitat loss and conflict with humans, typically when lions kill peopleÂÃÂªs livestock. Lions and other large carnivores are wide-ranging species, and designated protected areas are often not large enough to ensure their long-term survival. It is crucial, therefore, that conservation of these species, as well as their prey, is addressed throughout the landscape, which not only incorporates protected areas, but also the surrounding areas where local people live. @ewasolions is dedicated to conserving lions and other large carnivores by promoting co-existence between people and wildlife, they work hand-in-hand with local communities to provide education, training and improved conservation practices that help people and wildlife, using sound science to help guide the long-term conservation of lions across community conservancies and protected areas in northern Kenya, and I love their work _ÃÃÂ_ÃÂÃ_ÃÃÂ_ÃÂ__ÃÃ_to see more of it, follow me here @chancellordavid @thephotosociety @natgeo @everydayextinction @ewasolions #conserving #conservation #carnevores #northernkenya #kenya",250190,593,"['people', 'tribe', 'tourism', 'tradition', 'middle ages', 'travel', 'recreation', 'sand']",0.06838132861827466,Low

The beauty of the pheasant is apparent in even in death although the brilliance of its coloration I believe lessens in death.  When I was assigned to do the photography for this essay I really thought it would be popular with readers. I feared the recoil by those who might find killing a deer, such a graceful and docile animal, very distasteful if displayed in the magazine.  I could not have been more wrong.  The story ""Hunters"" received more mail than any other story published that year and response by readers was six to one positive.  I  believe the reason was very much influenced by the information given in the article about how hunting is part of the overall effort of conservation and managing wildlife in our country; from license fees wildlife refuges are helped to benefit bird watchers and those who simply enjoy the many areas set aside for wildlife habitat. #followme @williamalbertallard for more images of ""Hunters"" and other assignments spanning a five-decade career.@thephotosociety #hunter #pheasants #southdakota #pheasanthunting #birdhunting #blazeorange #onassingment",202796,2243,"['bird', 'recreation', 'water bird']",0.0655347679166816,Low

Jaguars have rebounded in this area where 95% of the land is privately owned. In the past many ranchers would kill the cats when they ate their cattle. Today in this area tourism brings in much more money to the local economy than cattle ranching. So the jaguar population is increasing. But revenge killings of jaguars happen close to this area and all throughout the jaguars range.

Stories from my parents made me realize how much the health of the estuaries and fisheries had degraded in just one generation. For the past dozen years IÂÃÂªve been focused a bit further inland, working to raise visibility of the Florida Wildlife Corridor ÂÃÃ a 17-million acre network of connected wildlife habitat that is very much threatened from expanding roads and development. The Corridor is hidden in plain sight for most of FloridaÂÃÂªs 21 million residents and 120 million annual visitors, and same could be said for the Gulf. I am thankful to have experienced the intersection of these two worlds during the 2015 #Glades2Gulf Expedition (supported by @insidenatgeo). This photo was made on Day 10 of that journey among tendrils of the Chassahowitzska River delta. I couldnÂÃÂªt find my team members to use as subjects during the first of the magical sunrise, so I set my camera on a tripod, started the interval timer and paddled off into the fog. The experience was one of my favorites from the 70-day trek. Later that year, this image was selected as the cover for The Forgotten Coast, made for PBS by @GrizzlyCreekFilms.

The trees have long been harvested for their resin, highly prized in the ancient world and still used today. Socotrans use it ornamentally as well as for dying wool, as a glue, and a breath freshener. Because of the belief that it is the blood of the dragon it is also used in ritual magic and alchemy.

This population is expected to triple in the next few years - and will be supplemented with individuals from other parks African Parks manages in Malawi to ensure for a healthy genepool - as well as help with tourism to the park, benefiting the surrounding local communities.

216,Photo by @beverlyjoubert ," ItÂÃÂªs a tough time of year in Botswana before the summer rains begin. Food is more limited - especially green, fresh, nutrient-filled vegetation. Elephants are lucky enough to have a very varied diet and spend the winter months eating more bark and woody vegetation. After a long winter, the reduced levels of nutrients can begin to take a toll on their condition - particularly in younger animals. The elephants will soon feast on green grass when the rains come, but right now theyÂÃÂªre actively digging for rhizomes and bulbs to supplement their woody meals.

I was assigned by @natgeo to photograph the Dalits, also known as the Untouchables, those people who exist on the lowest rung of the India caste system.  This man has just emerged from cleaning out a sewer filled with filth by using only a bucket and a rope.  After finishing and closing the concrete cover, he had to go to several nearby homes before gaining permission to wash himself off with a garden hose.  Because he is an Untouchable he is destined to do what his father, his grandfather, and all the men in his family's past did, to clean waste from sewers.  There are Untouchables generations destined to a tradition of washing clothes, or tanning leather hides, or other tasks members of the upper castes refuse to do.  Despite his situation, this man who sits covered in sewage, wears a thin gold chain around his neck and I was struck by how it seemed to match the glint of pride in his eyes as I made his portrait.

Photographing the hidden face of the iceberg has always been a fantasy for me. In 2015, during an expedition to Antarctica on the initiative of director Luc Jacquet (March of the Penguins), we found the ideal conditions for the fantasy to become reality: an iceberg that floated just above the sandy bottom at -40 m (-130 ft), motionless as it was trapped in the ice floe. It measured ""only"" 200 m in circumference but it was already too large to see it completely under water. It took 3 days of diving, accepting some frozen toes, and the use of panoramic photo techniques to successfully complete the challenge.

247,Photo by Stephen Alvarez @salvarezphoto ," A long extinct Steppe Bison painted on the ceiling of Altamira Cave, Spain. The cave of Altamira was reported in 1880 by Don Marcelino Sanz de Sautuola. It was the first paleolithic art cave to be identified. The cave was first greeted with amazement but the discovery soon deteriorated into deep controversy that followed Marcelino Sanz de Salutoula to his grave. In the 1880s it was thought that prehistoric humans lacked the capacity for abstract thought. Paintings like this could not have possibly been made by Ice Age people. It was not until other paleolithic art caves were discovered in France that Altamira was accepted as genuine. Archaeological deposits in the cave place human occupation between the Upper Solutrean and Lower Magdalenian eras (18,500-14,000 BCE). Uranium/Thorium dating of calcite deposits on top of some of the artworks place the works within the Aurignacian and Solutrean periods (36,000-22,000 BCE). This U-T dating suggests that Altamira was painted over a period of more than 10,000 years.To see more follow me, @salvarezphoto and my nonprofit @ancientartarchive.",279689,770,"['cave', 'formation', 'rock', 'organism', 'caving', 'geology', 'art', 'darkness', 'stock photography', 'speleothem']",0.07705804115852173,Low

Oysters filter the bay to clean the water.

I trust Kendall has weathered this hurricane. He and his family have weathered storms on the Gulf for more than a century. Hopefully he will be tonging for oysters and caring for the bay again soon. Maybe there will be a silver lining and the hurricane will have dissipated the red tide that has been plaguing the Gulf this summer, arguably exacerbated by pollution from millions of coastal residence who don't live in balance with the ecosystem the way Kendall does.

Damn you Phil Collins.When we work, this leaves me with a limited menu of grunting noises and the occasional guttural outburst, which I still find helpful in getting an animals attention. It also passes for a kind of barbaric shorthand between my wife Callie and I, until she tires of it and gets mad at me, which she finds helpful in getting my attention.Zorro is a 12 year-old Standard Poodle, too smart to get in the middle of our bickering. He tried to stay neutral but always sided with Callie. This is often the case with the nice lady holding food and I learn to live with rejection.This is more frustrating because Zorro is a very special dog that lights up a room when he enters and I want a dog like that to like me.More caregiver than therapy dog, Zorro has always been there for the people who needed him most, some at the end of their lives and some who would miss those people the most.Our connection was fleeting and dramatic and came together when I was finally able to vocalize a sound that engaged Zorro.

This gently portrait of an Amish boy holding his pet guinea pig started my career as a professional photographer and my 50 years as a contributor to National Geographic Magazine.In the spring of 1964, I was blessed with getting a photographic internship at National Geographic in Washington D.C. after showing my portfolio of work to Robert E. Gilka, the legendary director of photography at National Geographic. As my first assignment as an intern, Gilka sent me to Lancaster County, PA to cover a Pennsylvania Dutch festival. """"Try to get some pictures of the Amish, if you can,"""" he told me. It seemed the magazine had a finished manuscript about the Amish but had no pictures. He didn't tell he'd earlier sent a staff photographer to Pennsylvania who'd come back with nothing. Although I photographed the festival events my success with the Amish came through driving the country roads, introducing myself to Amish farmers, many of whom turned me down but eventually finding one who allowed me to photograph his family and their way of life.  My first assignment which was to have been for a weekend or perhaps a week, lasted through much of the summer and into the fall of 1964.  On an overcast afternoon, after photographing an Amish farmer working in his fields I was brought to the barn by his son so he could show me his pet guinea pig.  My portrait of the boy and his pet became the lead picture in my essay on the Amish of Lancaster county published in the August, 1965 issue, a story which has been credited as the beginning of a new, more intimate look at people in the National Geographic Magazine.#followme @williamalbertallard for more images of the Amish and other assignments spanning a five-decade career.@thephotosociety #amish #farm #onassignment #filmphotography",377113,1938,"['fashion accessory', 'headgear', 'hat', 'smile', 'facial hair', 'cowboy hat', 'fedora']",0.10905995973690288,High

She told me she loved to read and that one day she hoped to be a nurse.

I hope she accomplished her dreams. Like many developing nations, the literacy rate in Haiti is low and below the average for Latin American and Caribbean countries. Haiti faces shortages in educational supplies and qualified teachers where the rural population is less educated than the urban. A major earthquake in 2010 exacerbated an already difficult system by destroying infrastructure and displacing 50 to 90% of of students. Private education, which must be paid for, has substituted for education in public schools although the government has attempted initiatives to change this.  I tried very hard to help educate children in Haiti but the need was like a bottomless pit. In the world young women 15-29 are more than 3 times as likely as young men to not be in employment, education or training, according to UNICEF. Education can help change stereotypes we have held onto too long and take advantage of the talent and creative voices of girls to make a more vibrant and equitable world.

On this night, Luke's girlfriend Rachel joins for the ride. This is the final image in a photo story I produced during the Missouri Photo Workshop. I applied wanting to reconnect with the fundamentals of photojournalism and push to develop a picture story around the lives of people I had never met in a place I didnÂÃÂªt know. After two years of chasing Florida panthers with camera traps nearly full time, it had become common for weeks to go by without holding a camera in my hands. So I set the high-tech equipment aside and went to Missouri with just one camera for an immersive experience that involved a lot of looking, listening and waiting. Each student was limited to just 400 photos for the week, with no deletions. When I am on assignment, I often shoot 1000 photos in a day. But the workshop leaders encouraged us to trust the process and to be intentional about the moments we tried to capture. By watching and waiting we would know when a moment was building and we should trust ourselves respond. By Wednesday evening I had watched the Fry brothers drive the tractor two previous times. But when I saw this sunset forming and heard the tractor coming on the third night, I started running down the hill, remembering the floodlights on the cab that could balance exposure with the western sky. Had I not been watching the farm work for two days, I wouldnÂÃÂªt have reacted when this moment presented itself.

In Scotland the season runs from 01 October through 15 April each year. Much of the heather burning we see today takes place on grouse moors such as those here in the Cairngorm National Park, Scotland. Here for generations gamekeepers have burnt long narrow strips of mature heather on a rotation. How often depends on how quickly the heather becomes both woody and unpalatable, and tall and unavailable. After 2/3 years young heather plants will have regenerated from seed or old stools that survived the fire. If the temperature of the burning is too high, or the grazing pressures are high, the critical balance of growth and competition allows fire and grazing-resistant grass species to become dominant, and the heathland is replaced. By creating a patchwork of different aged heathers a gamekeeper aims to have some young heather for grouse, sheep, deer and mountain hares that is nutritionally richer. Patches are burnt every eight to thirty years.

Six Zakouma National Park rangers died in an attack by poachers who were members of the Sudanese military. A few weeks earlier, the Rangers found the poachers camp and took all their ammunition, their poached ivory and provisions. The poachers were out of camp at the time. These poachers then planned a counter-attack that began just before first light while the Rangers were sleeping. They would have woken to a hail of A.K rounds, the last sound they would ever hear. Djime Said was employed as a cook with the rangers in the rainy season. In his account, he said the pre-dawn night was very still when suddenly there was heavy firing out of nowhere. He found himself rolling down the steep hill that made up the Ranger post at Heban. He was shot but managed to hide away for the day and then come back to the camp that night where he confirmed that all the rangers were dead and the camp looted. He spent the next week trying to get help, two days of which were spent wading through a dense swamp on his way to aid. He received $2000 compensation from the Chadian government for his injuries but told me he no longer wanted to work for Zakouma after this experience.

As a consequence of its isolation, the island is home to a high number of endemic species; up to a third of its plant life is endemic. It has been described as ""the most alien-looking place on EarthÂÃÂ. The Dragon Blood tree (Dracaena cinnabari) has a unique and strange appearance, with an ""upturned, densely packed crown"". This evergreen species is named after its dark red resin, which is known as ""dragon's blood"". The trees have long been harvested for their resin, highly prized in the ancient world and still used today. Socotrans use it ornamentally as well as for dying wool, as a glue, and a breath freshener. Because of the belief that it is the blood of the dragon it is also used in ritual magic and alchemy. Human activities have greatly reduced the tree's population through overgrazing, and feeding the flowers and fruits to livestock.

Just 100 years ago there may have been as many as 500,000 lions which roamed the African continent but today there it is estimated that as few as 16,000 - 30,000 remain, and research by lion biologist Hans Bauer and colleagues suggests lions in much of west, east and central Africa will decline by 50% in the next two decades if something dramatic is not done! The biggest threats facing lions in Africa are poaching of their prey and retaliatory killings by farmers when lions eat their cattle! There is also an emerging threat of lions being used in Chinese medicine as tigers become rarer.  @wildaid ""When the buying stops the killing can tooÂÃÂPoisonings and poaching are the main threats to lions across their East African range. Most lion populations in East, Central and West Africa are declining so the time to act is now. There are fewer than 20,000 lions left in Africa, down from 200,000 just 100 years ago - and their long-term future remains in question: they are threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation, lack of prey, unsustainable hunting and now poaching for their skins, bones, claws and other body parts. But projects like these show how with determination, political will, community support, and simply envisioning a better future, we can bring this species back as well as protect our last wild landscapes, benefiting both wildlife and people, and creating a better existence for all.

311,Photos by @brentstirton ," In the October 2018 issue of @NationalGeographicMagazine myself and writer Peter Gwin examine the current state of #Falconry, with an emphasis on the Arab world. The Arabs have contributed a great deal to the recovery of falcons since the time of the Silent Spring. They have sponsored nesting sites in Mongolia to protect falcons on the steppes, they intensively breed prey species for hunting to minimize impact in host countries and their passion for the sport has led the creation of a new class of captive bred ÂÃÃsuper-birdsÂÃÂ that have come to replace much of the illegally trafficked falcon trade from the wild. The falcon hospitals of the UAE are something to behold as are the relationships between certain falconers and their birds, far surpassing notions of what is possible between man and raptor. Peter and I spent time with the influential master falconer Sheik Butti al Maktoum in the UAE and his breeding maestro Howard Waller. They represent a perfect example of how the natural world can unite people in a common mission despite huge cultural differences. I see great potential for better understanding between Islam and the West through the lens of conservation, a higher value system that should unite us in this time of divisiveness. In this story we also examine the deadly effects of electricity pylons and the way they kill millions of raptors every year. In an image seen here, over 300 precious Saker falcons lie dead, a tiny sampling collected over one year from a 55 kilometer stretch of powerline in Mongolia. Millions of raptors are killed in this manner every year. It only requires a small design tweak to prevent this from happening and all future designs could and should include this. #natgeo #falcons #conservation #UnitedArabEmirates #Falconry",239569,776,"['soil', 'waste', 'plant', 'grass', 'pollution']",0.06667230821906323,Low

I was coming out of a period where Id concentrated on the American West; about a 13 year love affair with the West. I realized I had to go to a different well if my work was going to grow; I had to find a different palette, a different culture. I heard through the grapevine that the magazine was going to do a story about Peru and I somehow felt an absolute need to get the assignment to do the photography. Here, in this image, done within just a few days of my arrival in Peru, I was in a small Andean village where six people had been killed by an earthquake. The Peruvian government had sent a helicopter with a medical team and a priest to the village and these young girls are peering, open mouthed, and awestruck. They had never seen a doctor before. While working in Peru I met and fell in love with a woman who several years later would become my wife. She was walking through the Plaza des Armas in Ayacucho during Easter week in 1981. I followed her around the Plaza for a while before building the courage to ask if she spoke English which she firmly answered, """"No"""". And that was that until another day not much later when I was able to engage her in an invitation to join my group to attend a cultural event one night, and with that evening the beginning of our romance took flame.

Grizzly bears are a true symbol for wilderness. Thirty years ago there were less than 150 grizzly bears left in the Greater Yellowstone area. Thanks to strict protection under the Endangered Species Act numbers of the iconic bears have recovered since then from near extinction to more than 700 individuals. This recovery, however, led to Trump administration to de-list the species from federal protection resulting in Wyoming and Idaho to issue trophy hunting licenses for as many as 23 bears.Just two days before the sports hunt of grizzlies in the area would have started this fall, federal judge Dana Christensen ordered that the grizzly bears kept their protection status.Less than 2,000 grizzlies call the Lower 48 states their home today, compared to more than 100,000 in historical times. Let give the surviving bears some space. Their habitat has been strongly fragmented, so the remaining bears are distributed over several island populations. Bears are facing increased pressure from the effects of climate change, like the loss of important food sources like whitebark pine seeds. It is essential to continue to work on restoring bear habitat, creating wildlife corridors and reconnecting the Yellowstone bears with the other populations of the Lower 48. That would allow for a true biological recovery so that those powerful animals to continue to roam the heart of the Rocky Mountains.",338465,798,"['polar bear', 'mammal', 'fauna', 'bear', 'wildlife', 'polar bear', 'grizzly bear', 'water', 'arctic', 'carnivoran']",0.09248418402182021,High

The hundreds of ivory tubes are pre-cut ÂÃÃhankos,ÂÃÂ a highly desirable personal stamp in Japan. Ivory in Japan plays out in musical instruments, hankos and netsuke, small ivory carvings. On more than one occasions I was offered ivory that it is illegal to export. Online, Yahoo! Japan offers illegal ivory for sale immediately accessible to a consumer market. In a recent environmental investigation, I worked with National Geographic writer Rachel Nuwer to examine JapanÂÃÂªs decision to continue with its domestic ivory market, despite China closing theirs in January 2018. This makes Japan the largest legal ivory market in the world. They have taken an attitude similar to their stance on whaling, placing a sense of nationalistic pride ahead of the lives of #elephants, some of the most sentient and #endangered animals on the planet. Japan has consumed ivory from at least 262,500 elephants since 1970, the vast majority from large, mature adults, according to Allan Thornton, president of the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA). JapanÂÃÂªs ivory industry today, Thornton adds, is ÂÃÃgreater than any other nation on Earth.ÂÃÂ While China had some 170 ivory outlets nationwide prior to its ban, Japan has 8,200 retailers, 300 manufacturers, and 500 wholesalers. ÂÃÃIn the 1980s Japan was so notorious, not only in terms of the volume of ivory it consumed but also for illegal trade,ÂÃÂ says Isao Sakaguchi, a professor of international relations and global environmental governance at Gakushuin University, in Tokyo. ÂÃÃJapan was responsible for the near extinction of African elephants in most of their range states.ÂÃÂ Legal trade in ivory inevitably creates loopholes for illegal trade and #Japan has loopholes you can drive a ship through. National Geographic writer Rachel Nuwer has done a superb job of reporting on the implications of JapanÂÃÂªs decision to continue with their ivory trade.

The church, AmsterdamÂÃÂªs oldest, has had every inch of its windows covered with red, inactinic masking film. The colour has a strong symbolic value in art history (the colour of sin, the devil, temptation: weÂÃÂªre in the heart of AmsterdamÂÃÂªs Red Light District) and also in photography where the church feels like the worldÂÃÂªs largest darkroom. The windows were for the first two hundred, Catholic, years of the churchÂÃÂªs history wildly coloured and pictorial.
