1,"Photos by @richardbarnes | After completing a photographic assignment at the California Academy of Sciences I was walking out of the African Hall when I noticed a painter on a Scaffold repainting a scene in a diorama that had been damaged by smoke from a fire that had recently occurred. I was struck by the strangeness of the scene of this beautiful surreal savannah with giraffe, wildebeest, etc. wrapped in protective plastic, juxtaposed with the painter amidst the tools of his trade. I received permission to return to photograph and this chance encounter led me on to the path to what would become my obsession with photographing Dioramas throughout the world in states of removal, restoration and often, sadly, destruction. There is a strange, some would say disturbing, irony, in going out into the wild and culling animals only to re-animate them to grace the halls of natural history museums.

When I first went to Peru for @natgeo it was to photograph an expedition to the Andes that was recovering Inca mummies from high altitude burials south of Cusco. One of them became known as the Peruvian Ice Maiden. Maybe because it was my first National Geographic assignment, but I have always felt a strong connection with her.  She was a girl of 16 wrapped in exquisitely woven textiles frozen into the 21,000-foot summit ridge of Mountt Ampato. The weaving tradition was strong in this part of the Andes for centuries, but by the time I arrived it had languished. With a grant from National Geographic, the Centro de Textiles Tradicionales del Cusco has helped revive, preserve, and pass on the Andean weaving tradition.

70,"Photos by @FransLanting | ÛÏA storm came and an island went.Û East Island was tiny, but for sea turtles in Hawaii it was the center of their universe. Now the island is gone, wiped out by Hurricane Walaka. East Island was one of the Hawaiian Leeward Islands, an archipelago of atolls that stretches for a thousand miles in the Central Pacific. Even though they are mere feet above sea level, they are home to millions of seabirds and to endangered green sea turtles and Hawaiian monk seals. All of them are now threatened by the extreme weather episodes and the sea level rise caused by climate change. The aerial view in this set of photos shows Tern Island in the French Frigate Shoals. It has an airstrip built in World War II to serve military planes. After the war researchers were able to use the island as a base, but now the island has been abandoned and its future is doubtful. It may be the next island in the region to disappear. It's unclear where the millions of creatures who depend on these fragile islands can go when the islands become submerged.

As dusk falls, the birds take flight in dense cloud-like formations known as murmurations. Surging through the sky, staggering numbers of starlings maintain fluid and cooperative movements as a flock, performing acrobatic displays in the evening sky. Ornithologists are not quite sure why they do these flocking maneuvers and how the birds keep from crashing into each other. And like finding seemingly recognizable figures in the shapes of clouds overhead, we humans bring our own sense of order and wonder to the shapes the birds make, even though the starlings, most likely, have no knowledge that their movements were enthralling to me, observing, beneath them.

Smoke was rising from the earth and the ground was still hot to the touch. There was no color, just black and grey. The scene suggested the snake had slithered as fast as possible to make it to the river, but that the burns to over half its body overwhelmed it, and the beautiful creature died just a few feet from safety.

This is seen in a number of mammals and most cats (including house cats), and allows them to check the reproductive or territorial status of others. Both males and females will bare their teeth like this when they come across a scent that gives them a chemical signal. This dominant male is testing the pheromones in the urine of a female who is coming into estrus and, after sensing her readiness, will track her very closely.

On this national holiday Mexicans sit around grave sites covered with flowers and candles, burning copal and drinking mescal as they tell old stories about loved ones who have passed.  Families share mescal and coffee and sing or play instruments until the sun comes up and shoots across the cemetery and then pack up and go home to continue the celebrations of the spirits who have passed. The families cook and eat the food favored by the deceased and build altars to them called ofrendas in their homes. Day of the Dead is celebrated from October 31 through November 2. The cemetery in the small town of Atzompa, five kilometers outside of Oaxaca de Juarez, is one of the loveliest in the state of Oaxaca. The holiday focuses on supporting the spiritual journeys of loved ones who have passed. Celebrations include festivals where people paint their faces and dress in costumes to dance and march to multiple parades that go on during the days and well into the nights.

Jaguars have rebounded in Brazil's Patanal, where 95% of the land is privately owned. In the past many ranchers would kill the cats when they ate their cattle. Today in this area tourism brings in much more money to the local economy than cattle ranching. So the jaguar population is increasing. But revenge killings of jaguars happen close to this area and all throughout the jaguar's range. Poaching for skins, bones, and teeth is also growing for the first time since the 1970s to feed the demand of people who think they receive the ÛÏpower of the jaguar through their teeth,Û Chinese traditional medicine, and now luxury items from endangered species. ÛÏWhen the buying stops, the killing can too.Û @wildaid My first story with big cats was the first @natgeo jaguar story 20 years ago!

Or are they forever locked in the images of man on sinking boats, of women, babies in their arms, crawling under barbwire, of families waiting in line, stranded in the shadow of borders we thought had forever vanished? I have tried to see things differently. I have learned that these men and women actually had jobs where they come from and now dream of being able to work in Europe. So when I set out to photograph a group of migrants eager to reach Switzerland but blocked in the city of Como, in northern Italy, I decided to show them as they would have liked to be shown. Dembo as a baker, Osman as a bus driver, Noreen as a nurse, and Jafar as a policeman. These are just some of jobs they used to do and are skilled in. But Dembo, Osman, Noreen, Jafar, and many others are now living in lurid tents, camping out in a small park adjacent to the cityÛªs station in squalid conditions. These photos are their CVs translated in images. I have borrowed the language of publicity to show what reportage cannot. These photographs are not totally real. But they should be.

People can play soccer, volleyball, hockey, basketball and tennis, as well as skateboarding, running and biking. /// From the project """"En Plein Air"""" -  In Rio de Janeiro, sports are life - and life is not a spectator sport. Little playing fields steal back space from the asphalt and traffic circles, defying cars and buildings alike. They creep in amongst the steep and winding streets and are sketched into the golden sands that have made this city immortal. Rain forests and granitic cliffs are a testing ground, where distinctions of gender, race or religion cease to exist. The differences between high and low are made level. Kids from the favelas that cling to the hillsides come down into the city, losing themselves among the upper-crust bourgeoisie well-heeled from Ipanema and Leblon. A surfboard, a soccer ball or a skateboard is all it takes to make them indistinguishable. Social background doesn't matter for the players of the Flamengo basketball team portrayed in this picture.

A variety of leaves, seeds, bugs, bird eggs and even the chest bone from a chicken collected from the Secret Garden of Lily LaPalma, a personal project that I began a couple of years ago to deal with a buildup of having witnessed a mixture of both the worst and the best of humankind. Many photographers have personal projects and it is these in which instead of telling the stories of others, we tell our own stories in whatever form we please. This is what the Secret Garden of Lily LaPalma is for me. In my career I have covered everything from war to fashion and seen great suffering and violence. I have told stories about heroic figures and those who were beaten down by life. We photographers choose to be in places where we see suffering and glory and to bear witness. But these things impact us in unexpected ways including a kind of longing for normality or loneliness or missing home or feeling completely disconnected from the world. We donÛªt realize the toll it takes on us until we are forced to face it. In the past two years alongside regular assignments, sometimes challenging ones, I decided I needed to play, to plant the seeds of new ideas, to be wild at heart without having to make excuses or explain myself, to tell my own story or a part of it.

142,"Photo by @CarltonWard | Did you know that the first modern cattle and horses in the United States landed on the Gulf coast of Florida in 1521? Ponce de Leon brought them on sailing ships from Spain during his second voyage to the New World. Although he was attacked by Calusa Indians (and later died of his wounds in Havana), cattle and horses remained. When my ancestors migrated into Florida in the mid 1800s, cattle had been living wild in the Florida woods for nearly three centuries. Descendants of these original Spanish livestock are called """"cracker"""" cattle and horses today. Early American settlers of the Florida frontier were also called """"crackers"""", attributed to the """"crack"""" of their cow whips. Modern horses actually evolved in North America but vanished during the mass extinction of mammals 13,000 years ago, near the end of the last ice age, around the same time when the human population was expanding throughout the continent. Much of the southeastern US was adapted to grazers. There were herds of wild bison in Florida as recently as the 1700s (and perhaps later). There are places today, such as the grasslands and prairies of the Northern Everglades, where modern cattle serve a beneficial role in maintaining native ecosystems. Cattle grazing in this region has been shown by @ArchboldStation to increase net carbon sequestration by grasslands. Ranches here also provide important wildlife habitat for bears, panthers and other native species while protecting land from development in the #FloridaWildlifeCorridor.

IÛªve travelled through this magnificent semi-desert natural region of South Africa many times, and each time IÛªve tried to capture the magnificence of this land. No exact definition of what constitutes the Karoo is available, so its extent is also not precisely defined. The Karoo formed an almost impenetrable barrier to the interior from Cape Town, and the early adventurers, explorers, hunters, and travelers on the way to the Highveld unanimously denounced it as a frightening place of great heat, great frosts, great floods, and great droughts and I totally adore it. Today, it is still a place of great heat and frosts, and an annual rainfall of between 50 and 250 mm, though on some of the mountains it can be 250 to 500 mm higher than on the plains. However, underground water is found throughout the Karoo, which can be tapped by boreholes, making permanent settlements and sheep farming possible. The driest region of the Karoo, however, is its southwestern corner, between the Great Escarpment and the Cederberg-Skurweberg mountain ranges, called the Tankwa Karoo, which receives only 75 mm of rain annually. The eastern and north-eastern Karoo are often covered by large patches of grassland. The typical Karoo vegetation used to support large game, sometimes in vast herds, but today, sheep thrive on the xerophytes, though each sheep requires about 4 ha of grazing to sustain itself - to see more work and projects from here and elsewhere follow me @chancellordavid @thephotosociety @everydayextinction - #southafrica #thekaroo","269,125 likes",https://scontent-dfw5-2.cdninstagram.com/vp/7a1a8235d1023f46a79e8e62a6705b22/5C7E22AB/t51.2885-15/e35/44487694_342546589637742_565893414405510265_n.jpg,463,"['sky', 'highland', 'cloud', 'ecosystem', 'wilderness', 'horizon', 'steppe', 'atmosphere', 'hill', 'ecoregion']"

What at first was a slightly nervous moment as this warrior simply came and sat next to me, has over the years developed into a deep respect both for the man and his work with @ewasolions in the Samburu, northern Kenya. The African lion population has declined by 43% in the last 20 years and lions now occupy only 8% of their historical range in Africa. The estimated numbers of lions across Africa are approximately 20,000. In Kenya, the national population now numbers less than 2,000 individuals. At current rates of decline, the species could become extinct here within the next two decades. This reduction in lion numbers is primarily due to habitat loss and conflict with humans, typically when lions kill peopleÛªs livestock. Lions and other large carnivores are wide-ranging species, and designated protected areas are often not large enough to ensure their long-term survival. It is crucial, therefore, that conservation of these species, as well as their prey, is addressed throughout the landscape, which not only incorporates protected areas, but also the surrounding areas where local people live. @ewasolions is dedicated to conserving lions and other large carnivores by promoting co-existence between people and wildlife, they work hand-in-hand with local communities to provide education, training and improved conservation practices that help people and wildlife, using sound science to help guide the long-term conservation of lions across community conservancies and protected areas in northern Kenya, and I love their work _ÙÔ_ÙÀ_ÙÔ_Ù__ÙÕ_to see more of it, follow me here @chancellordavid @thephotosociety @natgeo @everydayextinction @ewasolions #conserving #conservation #carnevores #northernkenya #kenya","250,190 likes",https://scontent-dfw5-2.cdninstagram.com/vp/13e8e019bc7833cda08b0a1e7b94c015/5C716EDA/t51.2885-15/fr/e15/s1080x1080/43666353_181924239393917_389349617467748883_n.jpg,593,"['people', 'tribe', 'tourism', 'tradition', 'middle ages', 'travel', 'recreation', 'sand']"

177,"Photos by @gabrielegalimbertiphoto | Do migrants have a past? Do migrants have a future? Or are they forever locked in the images of man on sinking boats, of women, babies in their arms, crawling under barbwire, of families waiting in line, stranded in the shadow of borders we thought had forever vanished? I have tried to see things differently. I have learned that these men and women actually had a job where they come from and dream of being able to work in Europe. So when I set out to photograph a group of migrants eager to reach Switzerland but blocked in the city of Como, in northern Italy, I decided to show them as they would have liked to be shown.  Dembo as a baker, Osman as a bus driver, Noreen as a nurse and Jafar as policeman. These are just some of works they are used to do and skilled in. But Dembo, Osman, Noreen, Jafar and many others are now living in lurid tents, camping out in a small park adjacent to the cityÛªs station in squalid conditions. These photos are their CVÛªs translated in images. I have borrowed the language of publicity to show what reportage cannot. These photographs are not totally real. But they should be. In order to illustrate the enormous chasm between their present and a possible future I have also done a series of still lifes of where the migrants actually sleep. ItÛªs in the space between these two worlds that the future of Europe will play out. /// You can find all the stories in my website www.gabrielegalimberti.com and instagram @gabrielegalimbertiphoto /// #migrant #migrants #job #jobs #future #cv #europe #borders #immigration #work #workingclassheroes","148,472 likes",https://scontent-dfw5-2.cdninstagram.com/vp/0585849d6c680e44bde62ad58c16e414/5C7A7407/t51.2885-15/e35/43613992_954007758133651_6512696826572619314_n.jpg,638,"['food', 'cuisine', 'dish', 'flower', 'lunch', 'meal']"

The trees have long been harvested for their resin, highly prized in the ancient world and still used today. Socotrans use it ornamentally as well as for dying wool, as a glue, and a breath freshener. Because of the belief that it is the blood of the dragon it is also used in ritual magic and alchemy. Human activities have greatly reduced the tree's population through overgrazing, and feeding the flowers and fruits to livestock.

216,"Photo by @beverlyjoubert | ItÛªs a tough time of year in Botswana before the summer rains begin. Food is more limited - especially green, fresh, nutrient-filled vegetation. Elephants are lucky enough to have a very varied diet and spend the winter months eating more bark and woody vegetation. After a long winter, the reduced levels of nutrients can begin to take a toll on their condition - particularly in younger animals. The elephants will soon feast on green grass when the rains come, but right now theyÛªre actively digging for rhizomes and bulbs to supplement their woody meals.

This man has just emerged from cleaning out a sewer filled with filth by using only a bucket and a rope.  After finishing and closing the concrete cover, he had to go to several nearby homes before gaining permission to wash himself off with a garden hose.  Because he is an Untouchable he is destined to do what his father, his grandfather, and all the men in his family's past did, to clean waste from sewers.  There are Untouchables generations destined to a tradition of washing clothes, or tanning leather hides, or other tasks members of the upper castes refuse to do.

247,"Photo by Stephen Alvarez @salvarezphoto | A long extinct Steppe Bison painted on the ceiling of Altamira Cave, Spain. The cave of Altamira was reported in 1880 by Don Marcelino Sanz de Sautuola. It was the first paleolithic art cave to be identified. The cave was first greeted with amazement but the discovery soon deteriorated into deep controversy that followed Marcelino Sanz de Salutoula to his grave. In the 1880s it was thought that prehistoric humans lacked the capacity for abstract thought. Paintings like this could not have possibly been made by Ice Age people. It was not until other paleolithic art caves were discovered in France that Altamira was accepted as genuine. Archaeological deposits in the cave place human occupation between the Upper Solutrean and Lower Magdalenian eras (18,500-14,000 BCE). Uranium/Thorium dating of calcite deposits on top of some of the artworks place the works within the Aurignacian and Solutrean periods (36,000-22,000 BCE). This U-T dating suggests that Altamira was painted over a period of more than 10,000 years.To see more follow me, @salvarezphoto and my nonprofit @ancientartarchive.","279,689 likes",https://scontent-dfw5-2.cdninstagram.com/vp/30d42c799a35d73fff5a3dba835ba019/5C7A147A/t51.2885-15/fr/e15/s1080x1080/43180288_316534135745674_2708807278158288725_n.jpg,770,"['cave', 'formation', 'rock', 'organism', 'caving', 'geology', 'art', 'darkness', 'stock photography', 'speleothem']"

In this photo, third generation Apalachicola Kendall oysterman Schoelles tongs for oysters in St Vincent Sound where one million acres of contiguous protected land extend north from the coast, providing crucial wildlife habitat while helping ensure the health of the estuary downstream. Oysters filter the bay to clean the water. In that way, Kendall and oyster men and women like him are protecting the Gulf for all of us, especially as they plant new oyster beds that also help buffer the coast against storms. I trust Kendall has weathered this hurricane. He and his family have weathered storms on the Gulf for more than a century. Hopefully he will be tonging for oysters and caring for the bay again soon. Maybe there will be a silver lining and the hurricane will have dissipated the red tide that has been plaguing the Gulf this summer, arguably exacerbated by pollution from millions of coastal residence who don't live in balance with the ecosystem the way Kendall does.

This gently portrait of an Amish boy holding his pet guinea pig started my career as a professional photographer and my 50 years as a contributor to National Geographic Magazine.In the spring of 1964, I was blessed with getting a photographic internship at National Geographic in Washington D.C. after showing my portfolio of work to Robert E. Gilka, the legendary director of photography at National Geographic. As my first assignment as an intern, Gilka sent me to Lancaster County, PA to cover a Pennsylvania Dutch festival. """"Try to get some pictures of the Amish, if you can,"""" he told me. It seemed the magazine had a finished manuscript about the Amish but had no pictures. He didn't tell he'd earlier sent a staff photographer to Pennsylvania who'd come back with nothing. Although I photographed the festival events my success with the Amish came through driving the country roads, introducing myself to Amish farmers, many of whom turned me down but eventually finding one who allowed me to photograph his family and their way of life.  My first assignment which was to have been for a weekend or perhaps a week, lasted through much of the summer and into the fall of 1964.  On an overcast afternoon, after photographing an Amish farmer working in his fields I was brought to the barn by his son so he could show me his pet guinea pig.  My portrait of the boy and his pet became the lead picture in my essay on the Amish of Lancaster county published in the August, 1965 issue, a story which has been credited as the beginning of a new, more intimate look at people in the National Geographic Magazine.#followme @williamalbertallard for more images of the Amish and other assignments spanning a five-decade career.@thephotosociety #amish #farm #onassignment #filmphotography","377,113 likes",https://scontent-dfw5-2.cdninstagram.com/vp/9d9afc410197045e10f11adce3ddac38/5C88E530/t51.2885-15/e15/43029475_683222338728182_1939048272715738181_n.jpg,1938,"['fashion accessory', 'headgear', 'hat', 'smile', 'facial hair', 'cowboy hat', 'fedora']"

IÛªm posting her photograph to remember her and other young Haitian girls today on the International #DayoftheGirl. She was a student in a small local school. She told me she loved to read and that one day she hoped to be a nurse. I never saw her again after that visit but I think of her quite often because she so embodied the spirit and talent and the hopes and sense of possibility that all Haitians share and that is shared by young girls around the world.  I hope she accomplished her dreams. Like many developing nations, the literacy rate in Haiti is low and below the average for Latin American and Caribbean countries. Haiti faces shortages in educational supplies and qualified teachers where the rural population is less educated than the urban. A major earthquake in 2010 exacerbated an already difficult system by destroying infrastructure and displacing 50 to 90% of of students. Private education, which must be paid for, has substituted for education in public schools although the government has attempted initiatives to change this.  I tried very hard to help educate children in Haiti but the need was like a bottomless pit. In the world young women 15-29 are more than 3 times as likely as young men to not be in employment, education or training, according to UNICEF. Education can help change stereotypes we have held onto too long and take advantage of the talent and creative voices of girls to make a more vibrant and equitable world.  There are many organisations, ranging from public to private, that support and promote the education of girls around the world.  If you want to make the world a better place and safer for young women, please consider researching and supporting the education of girls and give them a voice.#dayofthegirl  #tooyoungtowed  #unicef #educategirls  #haiti  #education","170,753 likes",https://scontent-dfw5-2.cdninstagram.com/vp/e17edd134acdd00b596c04bdf4cf76d4/5C6FB0C3/t51.2885-15/fr/e15/p1080x1080/42556782_471755369996563_2316533629282645255_n.jpg,529,"['face', 'eyebrow', 'nose', 'forehead', 'chin', 'head', 'hairstyle', 'cheek', 'temple', 'lip']"

On this night, Luke's girlfriend Rachel joins for the ride. This is the final image in a photo story I produced during the Missouri Photo Workshop. I applied wanting to reconnect with the fundamentals of photojournalism and push to develop a picture story around the lives of people I had never met in a place I didnÛªt know. After two years of chasing Florida panthers with camera traps nearly full time, it had become common for weeks to go by without holding a camera in my hands. So I set the high-tech equipment aside and went to Missouri with just one camera for an immersive experience that involved a lot of looking, listening and waiting. Each student was limited to just 400 photos for the week, with no deletions. When I am on assignment, I often shoot 1000 photos in a day. But the workshop leaders encouraged us to trust the process and to be intentional about the moments we tried to capture. By watching and waiting we would know when a moment was building and we should trust ourselves respond. By Wednesday evening I had watched the Fry brothers drive the tractor two previous times. But when I saw this sunset forming and heard the tractor coming on the third night, I started running down the hill, remembering the floodlights on the cab that could balance exposure with the western sky. Had I not been watching the farm work for two days, I wouldnÛªt have reacted when this moment presented itself. See the full story and inspiring work from other students through the link in my bio @carltonward.

284,"Photo by David Chancellor @chancellordavid | A gamekeepers apprentice extinguishing a patchwork of burning heather late into the evening, on Invermark, Cairngorm National Park, Scotland - Back in the Cairngorm National Park, Scotland for the muir burn - documenting a gamekeepers life - in this extraordinary landscape fire is still a commonly used and controversial agricultural tool, with farmers, crofters and gamekeepers burning grass, heather and gorse. In Scotland the season runs from 01 October through 15 April each year. Much of the heather burning we see today takes place on grouse moors such as those here in the Cairngorm National Park, Scotland. Here for generations gamekeepers have burnt long narrow strips of mature heather on a rotation. How often depends on how quickly the heather becomes both woody and unpalatable, and tall and unavailable. After 2/3 years young heather plants will have regenerated from seed or old stools that survived the fire. If the temperature of the burning is too high, or the grazing pressures are high, the critical balance of growth and competition allows fire and grazing-resistant grass species to become dominant, and the heathland is replaced. By creating a patchwork of different aged heathers a gamekeeper aims to have some young heather for grouse, sheep, deer and mountain hares that is nutritionally richer. Patches are burnt every eight to thirty years.

Six Zakouma National Park rangers died in an attack by poachers who were members of the Sudanese military. A few weeks earlier, the Rangers found the poachers camp and took all their ammunition, their poached ivory and provisions. The poachers were out of camp at the time. These poachers then planned a counter-attack that began just before first light while the Rangers were sleeping. They would have woken to a hail of A.K rounds, the last sound they would ever hear. Djime Said was employed as a cook with the rangers in the rainy season. In his account, he said the pre-dawn night was very still when suddenly there was heavy firing out of nowhere. He found himself rolling down the steep hill that made up the Ranger post at Heban. He was shot but managed to hide away for the day and then come back to the camp that night where he confirmed that all the rangers were dead and the camp looted. He spent the next week trying to get help, two days of which were spent wading through a dense swamp on his way to aid. He received $2000 compensation from the Chadian government for his injuries but told me he no longer wanted to work for Zakouma after this experience.

As a consequence of its isolation, the island is home to a high number of endemic species; up to a third of its plant life is endemic. It has been described as ""the most alien-looking place on EarthÛ. The Dragon Blood tree (Dracaena cinnabari) has a unique and strange appearance, with an ""upturned, densely packed crown"". This evergreen species is named after its dark red resin, which is known as ""dragon's blood"". The trees have long been harvested for their resin, highly prized in the ancient world and still used today. Socotrans use it ornamentally as well as for dying wool, as a glue, and a breath freshener. Because of the belief that it is the blood of the dragon it is also used in ritual magic and alchemy. Human activities have greatly reduced the tree's population through overgrazing, and feeding the flowers and fruits to livestock. One of the species' greatest threats is the gradual dessication of the archipelago.Follow @simonnorfolkstudio  for updates, outtakes, unpublished and archive material.@natgeo @simonnorfolkstudio #Socotra #landscape #soqotra #documentaryphotography #simonnorfolkstudio #simonnorfolk #documentary #reportage #Yemen #arabiansea #photojournalism #journalism #arabianpeninsular #arabia #endemic #threatenedspecies #endangeredspecies #simonnorfolkstudio #simonnorfolk #worldheritage #DragonBloodTree #desert #iucn #diksumplateau #diksum","480,700 likes",https://scontent-dfw5-2.cdninstagram.com/vp/f4b80f7ccfc1597025f616747d5ff70e/5C67B796/t51.2885-15/fr/e15/s1080x1080/43018314_1019423251571064_4289419586355816276_n.jpg,1094,"['nature', 'tree', 'woody plant', 'sky', 'vegetation', 'plant', 'landscape', 'morning', 'mountain', 'sunlight']"

Just 100 years ago there may have been as many as 500,000 lions which roamed the African continent but today there it is estimated that as few as 16,000 - 30,000 remain, and research by lion biologist Hans Bauer and colleagues suggests lions in much of west, east and central Africa will decline by 50% in the next two decades if something dramatic is not done! The biggest threats facing lions in Africa are poaching of their prey and retaliatory killings by farmers when lions eat their cattle! There is also an emerging threat of lions being used in Chinese medicine as tigers become rarer.  @wildaid ""When the buying stops the killing can tooÛPoisonings and poaching are the main threats to lions across their East African range. Most lion populations in East, Central and West Africa are declining so the time to act is now. There are fewer than 20,000 lions left in Africa, down from 200,000 just 100 years ago - and their long-term future remains in question: they are threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation, lack of prey, unsustainable hunting and now poaching for their skins, bones, claws and other body parts. But projects like these show how with determination, political will, community support, and simply envisioning a better future, we can bring this species back as well as protect our last wild landscapes, benefiting both wildlife and people, and creating a better existence for all.

311,"Photos by @brentstirton | In the October 2018 issue of @NationalGeographicMagazine myself and writer Peter Gwin examine the current state of #Falconry, with an emphasis on the Arab world. The Arabs have contributed a great deal to the recovery of falcons since the time of the Silent Spring. They have sponsored nesting sites in Mongolia to protect falcons on the steppes, they intensively breed prey species for hunting to minimize impact in host countries and their passion for the sport has led the creation of a new class of captive bred ÛÏsuper-birdsÛ that have come to replace much of the illegally trafficked falcon trade from the wild. The falcon hospitals of the UAE are something to behold as are the relationships between certain falconers and their birds, far surpassing notions of what is possible between man and raptor. Peter and I spent time with the influential master falconer Sheik Butti al Maktoum in the UAE and his breeding maestro Howard Waller. They represent a perfect example of how the natural world can unite people in a common mission despite huge cultural differences. I see great potential for better understanding between Islam and the West through the lens of conservation, a higher value system that should unite us in this time of divisiveness. In this story we also examine the deadly effects of electricity pylons and the way they kill millions of raptors every year. In an image seen here, over 300 precious Saker falcons lie dead, a tiny sampling collected over one year from a 55 kilometer stretch of powerline in Mongolia. Millions of raptors are killed in this manner every year. It only requires a small design tweak to prevent this from happening and all future designs could and should include this. #natgeo #falcons #conservation #UnitedArabEmirates #Falconry","239,569 likes",https://scontent-dfw5-2.cdninstagram.com/vp/52c4a773d101da6726a064a61dda6e47/5C726792/t51.2885-15/e35/40826000_560096084446433_3395589702705566979_n.jpg,776,"['soil', 'waste', 'plant', 'grass', 'pollution']"

I was coming out of a period where Id concentrated on the American West; about a 13 year love affair with the West. I realized I had to go to a different well if my work was going to grow; I had to find a different palette, a different culture. I heard through the grapevine that the magazine was going to do a story about Peru and I somehow felt an absolute need to get the assignment to do the photography. Here, in this image, done within just a few days of my arrival in Peru, I was in a small Andean village where six people had been killed by an earthquake. The Peruvian government had sent a helicopter with a medical team and a priest to the village and these young girls are peering, open mouthed, and awestruck. They had never seen a doctor before. While working in Peru I met and fell in love with a woman who several years later would become my wife. She was walking through the Plaza des Armas in Ayacucho during Easter week in 1981. I followed her around the Plaza for a while before building the courage to ask if she spoke English which she firmly answered, """"No"""". And that was that until another day not much later when I was able to engage her in an invitation to join my group to attend a cultural event one night, and with that evening the beginning of our romance took flame.

Grizzly bears are a true symbol for wilderness. Thirty years ago there were less than 150 grizzly bears left in the Greater Yellowstone area. Thanks to strict protection under the Endangered Species Act numbers of the iconic bears have recovered since then from near extinction to more than 700 individuals. This recovery, however, led to Trump administration to de-list the species from federal protection resulting in Wyoming and Idaho to issue trophy hunting licenses for as many as 23 bears.Just two days before the sports hunt of grizzlies in the area would have started this fall, federal judge Dana Christensen ordered that the grizzly bears kept their protection status.Less than 2,000 grizzlies call the Lower 48 states their home today, compared to more than 100,000 in historical times. Let give the surviving bears some space. Their habitat has been strongly fragmented, so the remaining bears are distributed over several island populations. Bears are facing increased pressure from the effects of climate change, like the loss of important food sources like whitebark pine seeds. It is essential to continue to work on restoring bear habitat, creating wildlife corridors and reconnecting the Yellowstone bears with the other populations of the Lower 48. That would allow for a true biological recovery so that those powerful animals to continue to roam the heart of the Rocky Mountains.","338,465 likes",https://scontent-dfw5-2.cdninstagram.com/vp/3b9eaeea8e39914983421a9dadaed9a2/5C6EDBA4/t51.2885-15/fr/e15/s1080x1080/42098525_319691498808168_6334273433027213477_n.jpg,798,"['polar bear', 'mammal', 'fauna', 'bear', 'wildlife', 'polar bear', 'grizzly bear', 'water', 'arctic', 'carnivoran']"

National Geographic launched the Big Cats Initiative to raise awareness and implement conservation action for big cats.Forests provide us with up to 50% of the oxygen we breathe - oceans the rest.Forest, grasslands and mountains give us 75% of the fresh water.If we can save the forest of the Amazon and other areas in Central and South America for the jaguar and Puma. The forests of Central Africa for the leopard, lion, elephants etc. And the forests of South Asia for the Tigers and Leopards. If you save the top predator in any ecosystem you save everything that lives with them.So if - We Save Big Cats we can help Save Ourselves.follow me @stevewinterphoto to see more images and thanks!@natgeo @thephotosociety @natgeocreative @eiainvestigator #leopardsÛ¬#photooftheday @africanparksnetwork  @sanctuaryasia","853,153 likes",https://scontent-dfw5-2.cdninstagram.com/vp/e775c7967585573f91247c5561314a7a/5C843C2B/t51.2885-15/e35/42002518_275996433241908_5804142003370720333_n.jpg,2676,"['leopard', 'wildlife', 'terrestrial animal', 'mammal', 'fauna', 'jaguar', 'big cats', 'carnivoran', 'cheetah', 'organism']"

Ivory in Japan plays out in musical instruments, hankos and netsuke, small ivory carvings. On more than one occasions I was offered ivory that it is illegal to export. Online, Yahoo! Japan offers illegal ivory for sale immediately accessible to a consumer market. In a recent environmental investigation, I worked with National Geographic writer Rachel Nuwer to examine JapanÛªs decision to continue with its domestic ivory market, despite China closing theirs in January 2018. This makes Japan the largest legal ivory market in the world. They have taken an attitude similar to their stance on whaling, placing a sense of nationalistic pride ahead of the lives of #elephants, some of the most sentient and #endangered animals on the planet. Japan has consumed ivory from at least 262,500 elephants since 1970, the vast majority from large, mature adults, according to Allan Thornton, president of the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA). JapanÛªs ivory industry today, Thornton adds, is ÛÏgreater than any other nation on Earth.Û While China had some 170 ivory outlets nationwide prior to its ban, Japan has 8,200 retailers, 300 manufacturers, and 500 wholesalers. ÛÏIn the 1980s Japan was so notorious, not only in terms of the volume of ivory it consumed but also for illegal trade,Û says Isao Sakaguchi, a professor of international relations and global environmental governance at Gakushuin University, in Tokyo. ÛÏJapan was responsible for the near extinction of African elephants in most of their range states.Û Legal trade in ivory inevitably creates loopholes for illegal trade and #Japan has loopholes you can drive a ship through. National Geographic writer Rachel Nuwer has done a superb job of reporting on the implications of JapanÛªs decision to continue with their ivory trade.

365,"Photo by @simonnorfolkstudio | In Amsterdam I caught the last few days of an interesting installation in the Oude Kerk by Italian artist Giorgio Andreotta CalÌ_. The church, AmsterdamÛªs oldest, has had every inch of its windows covered with red, inactinic masking film. The colour has a strong symbolic value in art history (the colour of sin, the devil, temptation: weÛªre in the heart of AmsterdamÛªs Red Light District) and also in photography where the church feels like the worldÛªs largest darkroom. The windows were for the first two hundred, Catholic, years of the churchÛªs history wildly coloured and pictorial. These were smashed in the Protestant takeover called, rather menacingly, Û÷BeeldenstormÛª (statue-storm), part of the Iconclastic Fury of 1566. Red has been absent from these cool, clean, whitewashed interiors ever since. ItÛªs most odd to be suffused in light of such a narrow spectrum. Emerging onto the street was like entering a murky chlorinated swimming pool.Follow me @simonnorfolkstudio for updates, outtakes, unpublished and archive material on this and future projects.Û¢@simonnorfolkstudio @natgeo #amsterdam #photojournalism #documentaryphotography #simonnorfolk #lensculture #red #beeldenstorm #OudeKerk #church #inactinic #GiorgioAndreottaCalÌ_ #netherlands #arthistory #redlight","254,115 likes",https://scontent-dfw5-2.cdninstagram.com/vp/46a1b4c3bec05e9c23f83ca2d27df889/5C7C6D07/t51.2885-15/fr/e15/s1080x1080/42002987_740733419597828_6574999220999353537_n.jpg,685,"['red', 'arch', 'light', 'architecture', 'structure', 'lighting', 'building', 'chapel', 'symmetry', 'window']"
